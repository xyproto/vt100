# Plans

- [ ] Fix the known bugs mentioned in `README.md`.
- [ ] Have only one cursor, the data cursor, then also a scroll position. Add a function for translating that to a screen position (respecting spaces per tab).
- [ ] Add scrolling when using the arrow keys.
- [ ] Add insert mode.
- [ ] Add a better status bar.
- [ ] Avoid choosing to be limited to `VT100` in the future.
