### VT100 Terminal Package

* Supports colors and attributes.
* Developed for Linux. May work on other systems, but there are no guarantees.
* Can detect the terminal size.
* Can get key-presses, including arrow keys.
* Has a Canvas struct, for drawing to a buffer than only updating the characters that needs to be updated.
* Uses the spec directly, but memoizes the commands sent to the terminal, for speed.

### Simple use

Output "hi" in blue:

```go
fmt.Println(vt100.BrightColor("hi", "Blue"))
```

Erase the current line:

```go
vt100.Do("Erase Line")
```

Move the cursor 3 steps up (it's a bit verbose, but it's generated directly from spec, memoized for speed and is easy to wrap in a custom function):

```go
vt100.Set("Cursor Up", map[string]string{"{COUNT}": "3"})
```

The full overview of possible commands are at the top of `vt100.go`.

### Another example

See `cmd/move` for a more advanced example, where a character can be moved around with the arrow keys.

### Features and limitations

* Can detect letters, arrow keys and space. F12 and similar keys are not supported (they are supported by vt220).
* Resizing the terminal when using the Canvas struct may cause artifacts, for a brief moment.
* There is a bug with how characters are placed and/or read from the Canvas struct.
