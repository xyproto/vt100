### VT100 Terminal Package

* Supports colors and attributes.
* Developed for Linux. May work on other systems, but there are no guarantees.
* Can detect the terminal size.
* Can get key-presses, including arrow keys.
* Has a Canvas struct, for drawing to a buffer than only updating the characters that needs to be updated.
* Uses the spec directly, but memoizes the commands sent to the terminal, for speed.

### Simple use

```go
fmt.Println(vt100.BrightColor("hi", "Blue"))
```

### Another example

See `cmd/move` for a more advanced example, where a character can be moved around with the arrow keys.
