# syntax

Syntax highlight text.

This is a fork of [syntaxhighlight](https://github.com/sourcegraph/syntaxhighlight).

Modifications have been made to output syntax highlighted text in a format that suites [textoutput](https://github.com/xyproto/textoutput) instead of HTML, so that it can be used in terminal applications.
